# Overview:

This is Practicums (now TripleTen) final project. It is meant to display different clothing options depending on the weather. The temperature at the top of the screen displays the current temperature of the location in which the API is taking data from.

# Functionality:

I started this project simply just building out the layout with flexbox and making sure the web page were responsive. As I progressed, there was the addition of authorization and authentication so that the user is able to create their own account and upload their own clothing images, there was the addition of forms, a like/dislike feature, an image deletion feature and the use of RESTful API's

# Technologies:

    Responsive web design
    JavaScript
    React
    Authorization/Authentiication
    classes
    REST API
